## Overview

The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze student data and predict outcomes such as exam scores, grades, or overall academic performance. The dataset used in this project consists of various student-related attributes, such as demographic information, study habits, and previous academic results.

The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on student performance data. It includes the following columns:
- `Age`: Age of the student
- `Gender`: Gender of the student
- `Study Hours`: Number of study hours per week
- `Previous Grades`: Previous academic performance (e.g., grades)
- `Study Methods`: Preferred study methods (e.g., group study, individual study)
- `Parental Support`: Level of parental support in academics
- `Extracurricular Activities`: Involvement in extracurricular activities
- `Performance`: Target variable (e.g., final exam score or grade)
